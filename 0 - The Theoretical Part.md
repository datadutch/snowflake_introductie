# Before going hands-on, a basic understanding about the Snowflake architecture is useful, as well as an overview of some of the features. There is a lot so this will not be complete.

## Just a database

When I started working with Snowflake back in 2019, it was an upcoming force. Via one of my old contacts, who was a presales at Snowflake at that moment, I landed a freelance gig at energy grid operator Enexis. We can truely say that, at that moment, Snowflake was 'just a database'. Enexis started a big migration from Oracle/BODS to Snowflake/Matillion. At my intake, the fact that I just followed nothing more than a training from the 'Hands On Essentials' was enough. I was able to 'learn on the job' for which I am still grateful.
