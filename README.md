# Snowflake introduction

This GitHub repository contains, on the one hand, several theoretical sections to introduce the technology of Snowflake.

In addition, there are code snippets available that can be used in your own environment via git clone or copy-paste.

## Starting a Snowflake trial

It is recommended to start a Snowflake trial for this purpose.

You can do so via this link: [Snowflake Trial](https://bidutch.medium.com/snowflake-30-day-trial-962793442668)

Some guidance for this repo: each markdown file has a number, if there are code snippets for the subject, they will be in a folder with the number.
